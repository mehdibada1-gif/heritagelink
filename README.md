# Heritagelink
HeritageLink is a mobile application designed to empower communities to preserve and celebrate their unique cultural heritage. By creating a collaborative and user-friendly digital space, the app tackles the challenge of disappearing intangible cultural traditions like stories, rituals, and languages. It specifically aims to bridge the gap between younger generations and elders, encouraging them to co-create a living archive of their shared history.

The app's core functionality allows users to easily record and upload audio, video, and photos of cultural artifacts and events. This content is then organized into a searchable, interactive digital archive. A key feature is the "Heritage Map," which visually plots cultural elements by location, making it easy for users to discover and engage with their local traditions. By combining modern mobile technology with traditional knowledge, HeritageLink provides an accessible and engaging platform for community members to document, share, and safeguard their heritage for future generations.

Ultimately, HeritageLink fosters a sense of local pride and strengthens community bonds by making cultural preservation a dynamic, collaborative, and ongoing process.
